> La vie, gâchée

The heated conflict between the Chicken Nuggets and the Gold Nuggets
has finally come to a head. There is no time left for excuses, no place for futile
negotiations. Civilization has crawled to a halt as the two most technologically
advanced species on Earth endlessly do battle, wave after brutal wave.

As long as they're gonna be doing that, we, the penitent survivors, might as
well bet on who's going to win. If you're lucky, you might be able to afford
fabulous prizes; earthly delights of which no man ought dare dream.
